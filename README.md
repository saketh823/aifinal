This dataset contains sales statistics for seven popular fish species from several fish markets. With the use of this dataset, a predictive model that uses machine-friendly data may be used to estimate fish variety.
I have implemented machine learning model as Random Forest classifier
Based on the weight, length1, length2, length3, width and height this model will predict the fish species.
With this model I have achieved 68% accuracy score.
